# Introduction #

This application is written in Java and is targeted for the Android Operating System.  The target Android OS is 2.2 and above.

This application utilizes libraries from the Spring Framework by SpringSource.  Two such components are the Spring Mobile and Spring Android projects.

## Requirements ##

These are the requirements for building and running the application in the Android Emulator.

  * **JDK**: Java JDK 1.5 or later

Optional Requirements
  * **IDE**: Eclipse-based IDE
